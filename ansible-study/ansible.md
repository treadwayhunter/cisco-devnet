# Learning Ansible
### YAML Basics
Ansible uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) for expressing playbookds
### Ad Hoc Commands
Commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions. Can be used for all sorts of equipment. I keep thinking network automation, but it can even be used to automate server operations, such as rebooting, file transfer, deleting whole directories, etc
### Playbooks
Written in YAML, Playbooks tell Ansible what to execute
* aggregation of one or more plays
* there can be more than 1 play inside a playbook
### Roles
* Useful for breaking down a playbook into multiple files.
* Excellent for simplifying writing overly complex playbooks.
