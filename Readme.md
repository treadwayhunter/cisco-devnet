# Cisco Devnet Study
## About
This repo contains my effort to begin studying for Cisco Devnet. Even though I am CCNA certified, I will go ahead and begin at the Devnet Associate certification level. This will be an excellent opportunity for me to mix my new programming skills with my network skills.
